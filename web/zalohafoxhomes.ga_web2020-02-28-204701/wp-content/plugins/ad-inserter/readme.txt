> The Best WordPress Ad Management Plugin?

[Ad Inserter review](https://www.shoutmeloud.com/ad-inserter-review.html) on ShoutMeLoud

> Both Google and Amazon recommend this plugin for inserting ads, which is a testament to its quality

**Endorsed by Google**

Google lists Ad Inserter plugin as possible solution to place code for AdSense ads into your WordPress site.

Ad Inserter is a perfect plugin to place code for Google AdSense ads at top positions for optimal monetization of your website: ordinary AdSense ads (ad units), AMP ads, Auto ads (page level ads), In-feed ads, in-article ads, responsive ads, AdSense ads that need page-specific header code, etc.

> If you're new to AdSense, one of your first tasks is to connect your site to AdSense. This requires you to copy the code on your AdSense homepage and paste it into the HTML of your page, between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags.

Check [How to insert ad code in your WordPress site](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7527509). Advanced users can enable [AdSense integration](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#integration): import AdSense ads from the plugin settings page - no need to copy codes for AdSense ads from the AdSense admin pages. List ad units, preview AdSense ads and get ad codes where you need them.

**Endorsed by Amazon**

Amazon suggests to use Ad Inserter to add Native Shopping Ads to Wordpress posts.

> Native Shopping Ads provide highly relevant and dynamic product recommendations in a stylishly designed and responsive ad unit that can be placed at the end or within your content to create a more compelling visitor experience and shopping opportunity.

Ad Inserter supports also advanced contextual ads: check settings for <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings#amazon">contextual Native Shopping Ads</a> that show ads with items related to the post content (using post tags).

And if you need more ads with page/category specific settings, ad statistics and metrics for impressions and clicks, A/B testing, lazy loading ads, sticky ads, slider ads, pop-up ads, geotargeting or geolocation to serve country-specific ads, functions to protect content from users using ad blockers, functions to serve different ads for users using ad blockers, multisite options to limit settings for ads, to block some IP addresses, to schedule ads, there is **Ad Inserter Pro** - all-in-one WordPress ad management plugin with many [advanced features](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/features):

Maintaining several plugins (often from different vendors) is not easy. And each plugin is slowing down the speed of your website.

**Speed Up Your WordPress: Replace them all with free Ad Inserter!**

**Quick Start**

To become familiar with the plugin check [Quick Start](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/quick-start) to display ads on your website.

To learn how to configure the most advanced WordPress AdSense plugin check documentation for [AdSense ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads): AdSense ad units, AdSense Auto ads, AdSense in-feed ads, AdSense in-article ads, AdSense AMP ads,...

Few typical settings are described on the <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">Common Settings</a> page. Please make sure you have also read <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/plugin-installation">plugin installation</a> documentation. For more detailed instructions please read <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation" target="_blank">Ad Inserter documentation pages</a>.

**Main AdSense Features**

*   Get code for AdSense ads directly from your [AdSense account](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#integration)
*   Create code for AdSense AMP ads from normal AdSense ad code
*   Create responsive AdSense code from fixed size AdSense ads
*   Create responsive AdSense code with [fixed ad sizes for differrent devices](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#responsive)
*   Optionally limit insertion to 3 AdSense ads per page
*   Disable insertion of AdSense ads on Error 404 pages
*   Insert AdSense In-feed or In-article ads between posts or comments
*   Debugging function to label AdSense ad blocks to mark [blank AdSense ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ads-not-displayed)

**Insert Any Code Anywhere on the Page - Automate Insertion of Ads**

*   Automatic insertion using standard WP hooks (the_content, the_excerpt, loop_start, loop_end, the_post,...)
*   Automatic insertion using custom WP hooks provided by themes (e.g. using <a href="https://genesistutorials.com/visual-hook-guide/" target="_blank">Genesis Theme Framework Hooks</a>)
*   Server-side or client-side (javascript) insertion before or after **any HTML element on page** (using selectors #id, .class)
*   Manual insertion with shortcodes
*   Insertion with widgets
*   Insertion by placing PHP function calls or custom hooks in your theme files

Ad Inserter is **the only WordPress plugin that can insert any code or ads anywhere on the page**. If standard insertions before/after post, content or paragraph can't be used, you can use advanced insertion [before/after arbitrary HTML element](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/automatic-insertion#before-after-html-element).

If you can create a CSS slector for the page element (#id, .class) then you can insert ads before or after that element. By default this approach uses client-side insertion using Javascript to insert code block after the page loads.

However, if you enable Output buffering (tab &#9881; / tab General) you can select also Server-side insertion which will insert code block the same way as other insertions when the plugin is called and the page is created.

Please note that **Output buffering** may not work with all themes - in such case you can still use client-side insertion.

**Please support plugin development**

If you are using Ad Inserter and you like it, then please write about it and spread the word on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ad-inserter/reviews/#new-post">review page</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated Ad Inserter. How can I use it? =

1. After activation, click "Settings / Ad Inserter" to access the settings page
2. There are 16 blocks - each block means ad code at some position (or multiple positions in some cases)
3. Put ad (or any other HTML/Javascript/PHP) code into the code window
4. Set automatic insertion option (for example: Before Post)
5. Enable at least one page type (for example: Posts, some insertion options don't work on all page types)
6. Save settings
7. Check also [common Ad Inserter settings](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings)
8. Check inserted code on the posts
9. Ads are not showing? Check [Blank AdSense ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ads-not-displayed) and [troubleshooting guide](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting#ads-not-displayed) to find out what to check.

= Settings for ads ... =

Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">common Ad Inserter settings</a>

= Does Ad Inserter insert any internal ads? =

No revenue sharing and no such thing as "internal ads" or "our ads" on your website. Period. What you configure is what will be inserted (+ some internal scripts for plugin features).
Ad Inserter is free, open source plugin and inserts only the code you configure (blocks 1 - 16, Header, Footer). The code you see is the code that will be inserted. Please check page source code before you make any conclusion.
Of course, if you configure code block with some javacript ad code, then this code may generate ads. But please, don't blame the plugin for this.
You can also use Ad Inserter to insert code for AdSense Auto ads on each page (usually in the header). However, **the exact placement of ads will be done by the ad code, not Ad Inserter!**
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads)

The easiest way to check Ad Inserter blocks is to use **Label blocks** debugging function:
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging)


= I have installed code for AdSense ads and I see ads placed at random positions. =

You are probably using code for [AdSense Auto ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads).

AdSense Auto ads (known also as AdSense Page Level Ads) is a code that you insert on every page once and it will automatically display AdSense ads on positions chosen by the code.
AdSense Auto ads use Google's machine learning to pick the best placements on your pages to show ads. You only need to add one piece of code to all your pages, and let Google take care of the rest.

AdSense Auto ads may not be suitable for some WordPress themes or layouts. In such cases it is easier to place ads at wanted locations by using [normal AdSense code](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ad-unit) and specifying exact locations where the code should be inserted.

= I have installed code for AdSense ads but the ad blocks are blank. =

Blank AdSense ad block means that the code is inserted properly only the ad code doesn't display ads. Typical reasons for this are the following:

*   After the ad code is inserted Google needs some time (hours) to check the pages before it starts to serve ads.
*   AdSense account is not fully approved yet - if your account is new you need to wait until Google checks ad codes on your website and and confirms your account. Usually this takes few days.
*   Your website or page is not approved yet - you need to wait until Google web crawlers check your pages.
*   Your website or page was not approved for AdSense ads
*   Your AdSense account is banned
*   No ads available for your website
*   Errors in ad code - check or regenerate ad code
*   You are using ad blocker

In such case you can try other ad networks for contextual ads. Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting#ads-not-displayed">Ads Not Displayed</a> for more information.

= What is GDPR? =

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation in European Union (EU) on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) that was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. If you collect personal information from any EU citizen (within or outside the EU), you must first obtain explicit and unambiguous consent.

= GDPR compliance: What cookies does the plugin use =

Ad Inserter itself does not use cookies except for ad blocking detection when you use delayed action.

In this case 3 cookies may be used (to store pageviews and action settings): `aiADB`, `aiADB_PV` and `aiADB_PR`. However, no personal data is stored in the cookies.

Of course, the ads you may insert with the plugin may use own cookies - please check with ad networks for details.

= How to display a GDPR compliant cookie message? =

You can use any plugin for GDPR compliance / cookie consent. For example:

*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/)
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/)
*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)

PLEASE NOTE: Installing GDPR plugin alone does not make your site GDPR compliant. Since ads you insert may use various cookies, you may need to make sure you have necessary configurations in place. Please check next question regarding showing ads based on visitor's consent.

= How to show ads based on visitor's consent? =

Ad Inserter supports inserting (showing) ads based on cookies or cookie values. You can define cookie conditions by black/whitelisting *Url parameters* (where also [cookies are checked](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/black-and-white-lists#cookies)).

PLEASE NOTE: If you are using caching (very likely) you also need to set **Dynamic blocks** to **Client-side insert** (tab &#9881; / tab General) in order to check cookies in visitor's browser and not when the page is generated.

For example, If you are using one of the following plugins for cookie consent you need to **whitelist the following cookie and value in Url parameter list**:

*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/) - Whitelist `viewed_cookie_policy=yes`
*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/) - Whitelist `cookie_notice_accepted=true`
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/) - Whitelist `catAccCookies=1`

= Settings for widget ads =

*   Enter the code for ads into any block, enable wanted [page types](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/wordpress-page-types) and save settings - widget is enabled by default
*   Go to Appearance / Widgets, drag Ad Inserter widget to the sidebar or any other widget position, select block and click on Save (button Save might be disabled until you make some change)
*   Optionally you can enable Sticky widget - this means that this widget (and widgets below) will stay fixed in the sidebar when the page is scrolled - Sticky sidebar or Fixed widget feature
*   You can also make other widgets sticky even if you don't use Ad Inserter ads - drag Ad Inserter widget to the sidebar ABOVE the top widget that needs to be sticky, select Dummy Widget for Block, check Sticky and save widget
*   In general plugin settings (tab &#9881;) you can also define Sticky Widget Top Margin to precisely define top position where the first sticky widget will stick

Additional note regarding *Sticky Widgets* - *Sticky Sidebars*:

There are two modes for sticky widgets (or sticky sidebars) available as **Sticky widget mode** in general plugin settings (tab &#9881;):

*   CSS mode - This mode is the best approach but may not work with all themes. CSS mode works by changing sidebar CSS to `position: sticky`. This works with most themes but not all. If your widgets and sidebar aren't sticking as expected you can use **JavaScript mode** described below.
*   JavaScript mode - This mode should work with practically all themes but may reload ads on page load when sticky sidebar is initialized.


= What is plugin usage tracking? =

When enabled, the information regarding WordPress environment and Ad Inserter usage will be collected and sent to plugin developers (once per month and on events like plugin activation/deactivation).

This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time. So if you have opted in (by clicking Allow when asked for permission) and now you would like to disable tracking, you should go to tab &#9881; / tab General, select **Disable** for Plugin usage tracking and save settings.

If this setting is not available then you have not selected any option yet - **tracking is disabled unless explicitly enabled** by clicking Allow when asked for permission (or when this setting is set to Enable).

What data is collected: Ad Inserter version, activation status, number of active blocks, date of installation, date of last saved settings, status of review notice and remote debugging, block class name, location, website url and name, WordPress version, language, text direction, charset, number of posts, active theme and version, list of installed plugins, PHP version, server name, IP address (used to determine country), site count for multisite installations, deactivation reasons and details (if provided).

Ad Inserter is only a plugin for WordPress content management software. It works together with WordPress, other installed plugins and selected theme.

This data provides information to make the plugin to be compatible with as many environments as possible, to test the plugin with commonly used plugins and themes, to understand why users deativate (and uninstall) the plugin and to get ideas to make improvements to the plugin.

If you are not happy to reveal this information and you have opted in, simply disable usage tracking as described above.

**Your decision will be respected.**


= Settings for contextual Amazon Native Shopping Ads =

*   Automatic Insertion: After Content
*   On all Posts checked, other page types unchecked

Sign in to Amazon Associates, go to Widgets/Widget Source, choose ad type and set parameters.
For titles and search terms use tags. For example, the code below would display amazon products related to the post tags - check documentation for all possible tags.

`<script type="text/javascript">
amzn_assoc_placement = "adunit0";
amzn_assoc_search_bar = "true";
amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "ad-inserter-20";
amzn_assoc_search_bar_position = "top";
amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "search";
amzn_assoc_ad_type = "smart";
amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon";
amzn_assoc_region = "US";
amzn_assoc_title = "Search Results from Amazon";
amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = "[adinserter data='smart-tag']";
amzn_assoc_default_category = "All";
amzn_assoc_linkid = "cf1873f027a57f63cede634cfd444bea";
</script>
<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script>`

Use your own tracking id! Please note `[adinserter data='smart-tag']` as default search phrase. This makes this widget contextual. It will show products related to the tags for this post.

You can also use [custom fields](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields) to make the widget contextual. For example, if you define in posts custom field named `amazon-keyword` you can use `[adinserter custom-field='amazon-keyword']` for `amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase` variable.

You can also try with `[adinserter data='tag']`, `[adinserter data='short-title']`, `[adinserter data='category']` or `[adinserter data='short-category']`. For more options check [Ad Inserter documentation page](http://adinserter.pro/documentation#code-block-options).


= I wish to show ads side by side but not in the same block. How do I do this? =

Configure block 1 and 2 with ads using:

*   Automatic Insertion: Disabled
*   Block Alignment and Style: No Wrapping
*   Enable shortcode: checked

Configure block 3 with

`[adinserter code="1" ignore="page-type"]
[adinserter code="2" ignore="page-type"]`

and use block 3 to insert ads.


= I use After Content insertion position but the ads are inserted after the stuff provided by other plugins. How can I insert ads directly after post content?

This happens because Ad Inserter processes posts last and therefore "sees" also content added by other plugins.

Try to set Ad Inserter plugin priority to 10 (early processing, Ad Inserter settings - tab &#9881; / tab General).


= How can I add some title or label (e.g. Advertisements) above AdSense ads? =

If this is a sidebar widget then you can simply name the widget.

For each code block you can also show a label above each ad. Default text (or HTML code) for ad labels can be set on the general plugin settings tab (tab &#9881; / tab General / **Ad label**.
To enable ad label above the ad go to code block for this ad, click on the Misc button and then on the Display tab check **Ad label**.

If you configured only text for ad label then the following code will be added above ad code: `<div class="code-block-label">AD_LABEL_TEXT</div>` (`code-block` is the block class name used, AD_LABEL_TEXT is the text for Ad Label).
You can then style the label using CSS for class `.code-block-label` (the best place for this code is Header section). If HTML code is configured for ad label then this code will be used (instead of the div code above).

In case you need a different label for some ad you can simply add label HTML code above the ad code. For example:

`<h3>Advertisements</h3>

AD_CODE`

Ad lables can be inserted only above ads (blocks) inserted by Ad Inserter - AdSense Auto ads are automatically inseted by AdSense Auto ads code.

= How can place ads below Read More tag? =

Configure ad block with the following options:

*   Automatic Insertion: After Paragraph
*   Paragraph Number: 1
*   Count only paragraphs that CONTAIN: `<span id="more-`

Check source code of your website for proper "read more" tag.


= How can I rotate between different alignments so I can test an ad aligned to the right against an ad aligned to the left? =

Set Block Alignment and Style to "No Wrapping" and create manual wrapping around both ads separated with [ADINSERTER ROTATE]:

`<div style="float: left; margin: 0 8px 8px 0;">
AD CODE LEFT
</div>

[ADINSERTER ROTATE]

<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 8px 8px;">
AD CODE RIGHT
</div>`

Please note that responsive AdSense ads can not work with floating alignments (ad container width is not known) - either use AdSense code with fixed ad sizes or don't use floating alignment.
